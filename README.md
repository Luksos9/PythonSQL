# Short descriptions of programs

## Diary App

> This program gives user 4 options: 
1) To add a new log entry
2) To view your entries
3) To delete entry
4) To Exit 

> All data is stored in created "data.db". JournalWithPythonSQL is very similiar, but this one im going to improve soon.

## JournalWithPythonSQL

> This program gives user 3 options: 
1) To add new entry, so he can store what he had learned and when
2) To view the entries that he made
3) To exit

> It stores all data in data.db file so after closing the program, data is not lost.

## MovieWatchList

> Program keeps track of movies the user is intrested in, and their release dates which he can input by himself.

> Stores which movie the user has already watched

> Adds new users to keep track of their watched movies separately

1) Add new movie.
2) View upcoming movies.
3) View all movies
4) Watch a movie
5) View watched movies.
6) Add new user.
7) Search for a movie.
8) Exit.

## MovieWatchListPostgreSQL

> This program is a child of its previous MovieWatchList. The difference between them is mostly that this one uses PostgreSQL as database.

> Main goal with this duplication was practicing switching between SQLite (sqlite3 module) and PostgreSQL (pycopg2) to solidyfying PostgreSQL knowledge.
